### What I learned

In this Exercice I learned How To implement the basic html5 stuff.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

In Future Projects, I will focus to use the max of what I learned early, and trying to do my best in each code section to make it more clean and efficient.
